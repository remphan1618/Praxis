Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched rudge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable.","constant":false,"selective":false,"selectiveLogic":0,"order":10,"position":10,"disable":false,"addMemo":false,"excludeRecursion":true,"probability":100,"displayIndex":10,"useProbability":true,"secondary_keys":[],"keys":["2 yo","1 year old","1 year-old","1 yo","newbor","months old","2 years old","2 year-old","age: 1","infant","baby","age: 2","2 year old"],"id":1,"priority":10,"insertion_order":10,"enabled":true,"name":"Infancy Stage","extensions":{"depth":10,"weight":10,"addMemo":false,"displayIndex":10,"useProbability":true,"characterFilter":null,"excludeRecursion":true},"case_sensitive":false,"depth":10,"characterFilter":null},"2":{"uid":2,"key":["","4","4 year old","4 years old","3 year-old","age: 3","toddler","3 years old","3 yo","age: 4","4 year-old","3 year old"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"","content":"Children 3-5 years old:\n\nGirl:\n- Hair: No pubic hair, but may have fine, soft body hair on arms, legs, and back, with the head hair now being longer and thicker.\n- Vagina: The Labia Majora is still small and in the form of 2 smooth paralell bumps concealing the Labia Minora and tender pink skin, The Labia Minora are flat, small and pale, only small ridges that arch above the vaginal opening.

A finger may fit in the vagina now. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.
